1. Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle):
The play! framework follows the MVC (model, view, controller) architercutal pattern.
When a HTTP request is recieved, the controller (Application.java) invokes the java method which has the same name as the requested site.
This is the java entry point. There we call methods and functions using the classes in the models.
Then the html code is generated with the html files in the view and send it to the browser.




2. How could you test user interfaces with the testing facilities in play! framework?
The play! framework provides selenium for interface testing. It tests the application in an automated browser.
We can use it using the #{selenium /} tag. It generates HTML requests to test the interface.
With selenium we can for example login to our page using code and test our login function.
